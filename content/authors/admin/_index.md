      Thesis on how human computation systems in the field of citizen science are formed in the interplay of various actors—such as developers, designers, researchers, and users—, in particular, how their human-technology relations unfold and continuously evolve alongside technological developments. Based on collaborative and ethnographic research I developed the analytical and reflective concept of intraversions for studying human-AI systems and to steer their development in directions that are beneficial to society. Grade: Summa Cum Laude. Published as "At the Edge of AI. Human Computation Systems and Their Intraverting Relations" (published with transcript in cooperation with Columbia University Press).

     summary: |
      I explored the limitations of traditional Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) in adapting to new ethical challenges posed by fields like AI and human computation-based citizen science, and developed and validated the CAER system, a Collaborative and Adaptive Ethical Review system designed to be dynamically adapted to varying ethical considerations across research fields. The findings suggest that CAER offers a more user-centric, efficient, accessible, and adaptable approach to ethical review, necessary to ensure that AI research is conducted in an ethical manner.

## About Me

Since October 2023, I have been a postdoctoral researcher at the Ludwig Uhland Institute, developing my habilitation project at the intersection of digital anthropology, anthropology of technology, and Science and Technology Studies. My current research focuses on digital everyday life and human-technology relations in sociotechnical systems. I am particularly interested in how new technologies such as Artificial Intelligence are shaped and negotiated by different actors, while simultaneously transforming the practices of actors and their perceptions of these in their everyday lives. Additionally, my work involves further developing ethnographic methods for analyzing digital data and algorithmic phenomena.
After completing my studies in Cultural Anthropology and Computer Science at Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich, I worked as a research associate at the Institute for European Ethnology and Cultural Analysis from 2019 to 2023. There, I completed my doctoral studies in September 2023 as part of the DFG-funded project "Spielend in the Loop" (DFG – 464513114, led by Prof. Dr. Johannes Moser) with my dissertation titled "At the edge of Artificial Intelligence: Intraversions in Human Computation Systems."
In addition to teaching, my responsibilities at the Ludwig-Uhland Institute include coordinating the Digital Anthropology Lab and managing the IT infrastructure.
